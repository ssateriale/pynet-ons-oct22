Using {{ repo }}/day4/aruba_get/aruba_showcommand.py as a model, connect to the Aruba Controller and execute the
following "showcommand": 

show configuration node-hierarchy

Parse the data-structure that is returned and extract both the "Config Node" and the "Type" fields.

For any "Config Node" with a type of "Device", print both the "Config Node" path and the "Type". The output should 
look similar to the following:

Config Node: /md/40Lab/VH/20:4c:03:39:5a:fc --> Type: Device
Config Node: /md/40Lab/VH/20:4c:03:58:70:72 --> Type: Device
