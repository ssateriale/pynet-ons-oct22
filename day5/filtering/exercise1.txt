Using the standard Aruba "auth" function located in "src" connect to the Aruba Controller.

Perform an HTTP Get using:
--------
base_url = f"https://{host}:{api_port}/v1/configuration/"
relative_url = "object/int_gig"
--------

With a config_path of:
--------
config_path = "?config_path=/md/40Lab/VH/20:4c:03:39:5a:fc"
--------

rich.print the resulting data structure to the screen.


Now that you have viewed the full data-structure, create a filter that delimits the output to only the "slot/module/port" field.

Your filter should look as follows:

filter=[{"OBJECT": {"$eq": ["int_gig.slot/module/port"]}}]

And this gets applied to the end of the query string.
