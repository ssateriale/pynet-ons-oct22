Using the standard Aruba "auth" function located in "src", connect to the Aruba Controller.

Perform an HTTP Get using:
---------------
base_url = f"https://{host}:{api_port}/v1/configuration/"
relative_url = "object/vlan_name_id"
---------------

With a config_path of:
---------------
config_path = "?config_path=/md/40Lab/VH/"
---------------

rich.print the resulting data structure to the screen.


Now that you have viewed the full data-structure, create a filter that delimits the output to only 
VLANs with "guest" in their name

rich.print the data structure returned using this filter to standard output.
