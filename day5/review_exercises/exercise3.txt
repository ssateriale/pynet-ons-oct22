Using the config_change method in aruba_class.py, configure "object/ip_name_server" using 
a config_path="/md/40Lab" and a payload of:

payload = {"address": "8.8.8.8"}

Complete this change by executing "object/write_memory" via the API. Once again, use the 
config_change method in aruba_class.py to accomplish this. Your payload will be empty.
