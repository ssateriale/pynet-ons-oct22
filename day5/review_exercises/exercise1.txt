Using entirely the functions located in the aruba_auth.py module, connect to the Aruba controllers and 
retrieve "object/ssid_prof" (use a config_path="/md/40Lab")

Use rich.print() to print the returned data structure to standard output.

Repeat this process except apply an "object" filter such that only the "profile-name" field and the 
"ssid_enable" fields are returned for each SSID Profile.

Make sure you call the "logout" function at the end of your program.
