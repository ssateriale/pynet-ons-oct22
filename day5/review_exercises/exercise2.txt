Using the functions located in the aruba_auth.py module, connect to the Aruba controllers.

Use the "show_command" to execute "show ap radio-database". Retrieve the JSON response from this 
and use rich.print() to print this to standard output.

Further process the response data, such that you create a new list. Each entry in the list should 
be a tuple/list consisting of (AP-Name, AP-IP_Address). Use rich.print() to print out this new 
data structure.

Your output should look similar to the following:

----------
[('AP-01', '10.5.235.26'), ('AP-02', '10.5.235.30'), 
 ('AP-03', '10.5.235.32'), ('AP-04', '10.5.235.31')]
----------

Use the "logout" function and gracefully logout.
