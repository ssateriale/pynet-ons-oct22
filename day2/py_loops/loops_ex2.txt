Loops Exercise 2
----------------

1. Take a timestamp using time.time().

2. Enter into a while loop. Stay in this while loop until 15 seconds have passed (relative to your timestamp).

3. Inside the while loop, sleep for 1 second. Additionally, print out the elapsed time since your timestamp.

4. You should exit your while loop after 15 seconds have passed.

5. Outside of the while loop. Print the total elapsed time (one last time).
